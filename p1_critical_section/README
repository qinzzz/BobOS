Due dates:
    test: 1/26/2020 @ 11:59pm
    code: 1/27/2020 @ 11:59pm

Objectives:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - Become familiar with the bootstrap kernel
    - Become familiar with the build environment
    - Think about concurrency issues
    - Start looking at C++ code

Given:
~~~~~~

A minimal bootstrap kernel that:

    - boots on QEMU
    - switches the processor to 32 bit mode
    - discovers its environment (number of processor and memory ranges)
    - creates a rudimentary console that allows us to print text messages
    - initializes all processors
    - starts all processors in kernelMain

Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    - understand the code
    - answer the questions in REPORT.txt
    - edit kernel/critical.cc in order to produce the correct output
    - donate a test case

Rules:
~~~~~~

    - You're only allowed to change kernel/critical.cc

Your test case:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     You need to add 2 files:
  
        <your csid>.cc
        <your csid>.ok

     The .cc contains the code to run and the .ok file contains the expected
     output.

     Please note that only lines that start with "***" are compared with
     the contents of the .ok file.

To compile:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    make

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make clean test

To make the output less noisy:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s clean test

To run a test by hand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make <test name>.kernel
    ./run_qemu <test name>

To attach with gdb
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's a good idea to change the -O3 to -O0 in common.mak if you want to debug
with gdb

    make <test name>.kernel
    ./debug_qemu <test name>

  then in another window

    > gdb kernel/kernel
    (gdb) target remote localhost:1234
    (gdb) # define breakpoint, etc
    (gdb) cont

Test input/output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

files committed to git

<test>.cc      the test code
<test>.ok      the expected output

files ignored by git

<test>.raw     the raw output from running the test
<test>.out     the raw output after removing lines that
               don't start with ***
<test>.diff    the difference between <test>.ok and <test>.out
<test>.result  the result (either "pass" or "fail")
